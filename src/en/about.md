### i do creative things and sometimes i write code

You can find some of the things I've been working on at my GitHub or my
Printables link below.

I also work in open source, presently for AWS. Other than work in my official
capacity, which in on GitHub, opinions expressed on this site and my other
online profiles are my own and not necessarily those of my employer. :)

When I'm not writing code I have quite a few hobbies that keep me busy. Maybe
I'll post about them here sometime.

I have two cats and I live in Seattle, WA.
